This is the public repository for the Masterchef game in Code Day.

CORE GAME  : 
- multiple foodstuffs fall from the top of the screen. It is the chef's 
  responsibility to run to the foodstuffs and bounce them off the wall. 
  the bounced foodstuffs will collide and fall back :  
  if it is a good pair of foodstuffs, then the chef will want to hit the 
  new meal through the 'window' at the top of the screen. If it's a bad meal,
  the chef will want to avoid it ... or else he'll lose money on the crappy 
  meal ! 
FEATURES WE'LL WANT LATER :
- scoring system : players can spend the money they earn from meals
  on various "fists" for combining meals 
- enemies ?! people in the kitchen that are planning on stealing your precious 
  meal and sell it themselves ?!

  I think this was the first hackathon I ever attended. Unfortunately, I completely forgot how exactly to build this; I know we relied on the build process of the IDE. However, I did manage to resurrect some GIFs from the depths of my old computer's hard drive of various parts of this game's development!
